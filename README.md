CEmu is a third-party TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculator emulator, focused on developer features.  
CEmu works natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For performance and portability, the core is programmed in C and its customizable GUI in C++ with Qt.

_Note: CEmu is not a TI product nor is it TI-endorsed/affiliated. If you need an official TI CE emulator, TI-SmartViewâ„¢ CE is for you._

## Downloads
