CEmu is a third-party TI-84 Plus CE / TI-83 Premium CE calculator emulator, focused on developer features.  
CEmu works natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux. For performance and portability, the core is programmed in C and its customizable GUI in C++ with Qt.

_Note: CEmu is not a TI product nor is it TI-endorsed/affiliated. If you need an official TI CE emulator, TI-SmartViewâ„¢ CE is for you._

## Downloads
Official stable releases are available here: https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/releases  
Development builds are available on the auto-updating ["nightly" pre-release](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/releases/tag/nightly).

_Note that Release builds have an update checking feature, which is disabled in development builds._

## Features

* Resizable calculator screen
* "Always-on-top" window option
* Screen capture, copy, and drag'n'drop (PNG)
* Screen recording (animated PNG)
* USB emulation for transfers (including for Apps and OSes)
* USB emulation for flash drive images and external devices (via libusb)
* Customizable keybindings with multiple presets
* Keypress recording and history

## How to build

You can find information for building CEmu yourself from the source on [this wiki page](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/wiki/Building-CEmu).  
If you encounter any problems, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/issues)!

## Getting Help

You can join us on the `CE Programming` Discord server in the `#cemu-emulator` channel: [Discord Chat Link](https://discord.gg/CyUmEx9zmQ).\
If you prefer IRC, the chat is also bridged to the EFNet `#cemu-dev` channel (you can use a web client like [IRCCloud](https://www.irccloud.com/irc/efnet/channel/cemu-dev), if you don't want to use a local application).

Depending on how active the channel is you might not get a response.\
In that case, post your questions [here](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/issues), and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

## Contributing

You're welcome to [report any bugs](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/issues) you may encounter, in addition to any [feature requests](https://github.com/CE-Programming/CEmu/issues) you may have. If you want to help, tell us, or send patches / pull requests!

If you'd like to contribute code, please consider using [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) with the settings specified in the `.astylerc` file to format your code. Qt Creator can [format code with Artistic Style](http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-beautifier.html) with minimal setup.  
We also welcome more translations. Qt Linguist is a great tool for that (here's [a tutorial](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-manager.html)).
